                        Keeping your crowning glory looking its finest requires
                        the correct type of hairbrush. With so many options
                        available, selecting the right one can be confusing. A
                        hairbrush for routine brushing should be selected based
                        on the texture and length of your hair.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        There are also specific brushes that can be used when
                        styling hair. Knowing what options are available will
                        narrow your search when shopping for your next
                        hairbrush.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Hairbrushes are available in a variety of designs. The
                        bristles on each type of brush differ in their
                        arrangement, length, stiffness, number, and the
                        materials from which they are made. Hairbrush bristles
                        can be synthetic, boar bristle, metal, or wooden.

                    <p>
                        Knowing your hair type and any specific needs are the
                        most important factors when choosing a hairbrush.
                        Specific hair conditions like thinning hair or extremely
                        damaged hair may need special care. Selecting a brush
                        that will not only order the hair but also gently
                        stimulate the scalp is essential.

                        Many of us remember our mothers dragging a brush
                        painfully through our manes before school when we were
                        kids. Fortunately, new materials and designs are now
                        available that is gentle enough even for a baby’s fine
                        hair.

                        <p>
                            A good detangling brush is a must-have for everyone
                            who has medium to long hair. These versatile brushes
                            have thin, flexible bristles that gently separate
                            tangled hair while brushing. Detangling brushes work
                            well to tame children’s hair painlessly.

                        <p>
                            A wet hairbrush is specifically for use on wet hair.
                            It often has the same features as a detangling brush
                            which is used as a wet brush. The bristles are
                            flexible and soft so that hair is gently unknotted
                            while it massages the scalp.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            During swimming or washing, long hair often becomes
                            more tangled than usual. While it is wet, hair is
                            more prone to damage or breakage, so it is essential
                            to use a fine and soft hairbrush that won’t rip out
                            clumps when it encounters a tangle.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Wet brushes are designed so that they will remain
                            gentle even if you accidentally brush a little too
                            hard.

                        <p>
                            Shower hairbrushes are usually similar to
                            hairbrushes designed for use on wet hair. Its main
                            defining characteristic is that it features a
                            hanging hook that makes it handy to keep in the
                            shower. The bristles are highly flexible to reduce
                            hair breakage and split ends while hair is wet. The
                            brush will gently loosen knots without pulling or
                            breaking hair.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Shower hair brushes are designed with ergonomically
                            designed grips that can be held securely while
                            showering. This type of hairbrush is lightweight and
                            vented so that it dries quickly after each use.

                        <p>
                            A cushion hairbrush has bristles set in a rubber
                            cushion base. The bristles are made of ball-tipped
                            nylon, plastic, or wire is a firm yet flexible
                            option to tame even the most stubborn hair types.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            The soft rubber base provides cushioning so that you
                            don’t apply too much pressure to your sensitive
                            scalp, but at the same time, allow the stiff
                            bristles to stimulate the hair follicles.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Cushion hairbrushes are especially recommended for
                            people with frizzy hair because the bristles are
                            strong enough to move between the hair all the way
                            to the scalp. They can also be used by those who
                            frequently use hair styling products or struggle
                            with dandruff.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Cushion brushes will effectively brush through all
                            the layers of hair and make the hair appear cleaner
                            after being brushed.

                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Thermal hairbrushes have a round barrel that quickly
                            diffuses warm air through the brush and allows hair
                            to dry faster while blowdrying. The barrels of
                            thermal brushes are made of materials like ceramic,
                            titanium, or tourmaline. These quickly spread the
                            heat from the hairdryer evenly through to all parts
                            of the hair.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Thermal brushes come in different sizes. The thinner
                            ones are perfect for short styles where you want to
                            lift each group of hair before drying to create
                            height. Thermal brushes with a larger circumference
                            work well to add volume to long hair while
                            blowdrying.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Using a thermal brush will speed up the amount of
                            time required to style hair while blowdrying.
